## This application was created at a hackathon called Hackchella where we were tasked to use blockchain api and create something that could change the world


## Upon realizing that the medical field has issues with there file sharing we took the initiative to create a application that encrypts and decrypts text files so that sharing a file can be secure

- To view the file just go into the src folder and run 'java test' as a command line or use eclipse to run the file to load the application

- this file uses both java (for functionality and the GUI) and python (for the encryption and decryption)
